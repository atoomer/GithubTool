# Microsoft GUI for GitHub 
## About this GUI
This GitHub GUI application is a tool to help its user create a GitHub repository without using their command line. To do this, the application uses [GitSubprocessClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitSubprocessClient) and [GitHubApiClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitHubApiClient). Java Swing is used for the GUI of the application.

## How to Use

The user of this application is able to create a new repository by entering the file path that they want to make their repo in. The user will need to enter their GitHub username, token, and a name for the repository. The application will ask if the repository should be private or public, and a URL to the new repository will be given to the user.

## How to Run

Java version 8 or higher is required.
